Mounts the StatChasers NFL news tool, the 32 team hubs, the player pages, the Fantasy Points Allowed table and the redraft rankings into WordPress pages.

== Why this file exists ==

WordPress reads the plugin version from the PHP header, and PHP files execute
rather than serve — so from outside the server there is no way to tell which
version is actually on disk. This file is served as-is, so

    https://<site>/wp-content/plugins/statchasers-news/readme.txt

answers that question directly, with a Last-Modified header that says when the
upload landed. Keep "Stable tag" in step with the Version header.

== Changelog ==

= 1.7.0 =
* Tools -> StatChasers Pages now builds the player profile pages as well, in resumable batches of 25, and the matchup holder page beside them.
* Page headings: the plugin fetches one published page and counts its H1 elements, then prints its own heading only on a template that prints none. Re-checked on a theme switch; overridable from the same screen.
* An H1 on every matchup URL. One holder page serves 496 addresses and they all used to share the holder's heading.
* Team section URLs, player section URLs and matchup pair URLs are on by default, with the permalink flush done on activation instead of by hand.
* The team News tab has a public address, /nfl/teams/<team>/news/, like the other five.

= 1.6.0 =
* [statchasers_rankings]: the redraft rankings board, ported from the standalone Redraft-Rankings-table app. All five position panels are server-rendered into the page, not filled in by React after load.

= 1.3.1 =
* Renamed from "StatChasers News" to "StatChasers" — the plugin has carried the team hubs as well as the news tool since 1.0.0, and the old name sent people looking for a second plugin that does not exist.

= 1.3.0 =
* Tools -> StatChasers Team Pages: one button creates all 32 team hub pages.
* Admin notice while pages are missing.

= 1.2.0 =
* Force Divi's full-width layout on pages mounting the team hub.

= 1.1.0 =
* Same, first attempt (body class only; not sufficient on its own).

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
